from bs4 import BeautifulSoup: This line imports the BeautifulSoup class from the bs4 module. BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for web scraping and parsing HTML or XML documents.

import requests: This line imports the requests module, which allows making HTTP requests to retrieve web pages and interact with web servers.

headers = {'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/15.3 Safari/605.1.15'}: This line defines a dictionary called headers with a key-value pair. It sets the User-Agent header in the HTTP request to mimic the user agent of a Safari browser on a Macintosh computer. It is done to prevent the request from being blocked or rejected as a bot.

def weather_info(city):: This line defines a function called weather_info that takes a city parameter. The function will retrieve and print weather information for the specified city.

city = city.replace(" ", "+"): This line replaces any spaces in the city parameter with the + symbol. It is done to format the city name correctly for the URL.

res = requests.get(f'https://www.google.com/search?q={city}&hl=en', headers=headers): This line sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, which is a Google search page for the given city. The requests.get() function returns a Response object, which is assigned to the variable res. The headers dictionary is passed along with the request to provide the user agent information.

soup = BeautifulSoup(res.text, 'html.parser'): This line creates a BeautifulSoup object called soup by parsing the HTML content of the response text obtained in the previous step. The 'html.parser' argument specifies the parser to be used for parsing the HTML.

location = soup.select('#wob_loc')[0].getText().strip(): This line selects the HTML element with the ID wob_loc from the parsed HTML using the soup.select() method. It retrieves the text content of the selected element, removes any leading or trailing whitespace using the strip() method, and assigns the result to the variable location. This line extracts the location information from the weather page.

time = soup.select('#wob_dts')[0].getText().strip(): This line is similar to the previous line but extracts the time information from the weather page using the element with the ID wob_dts. The extracted text is assigned to the variable time.

info = soup.select('#wob_dc')[0].getText().strip(): This line extracts the weather condition information from the weather page using the element with the ID wob_dc. The extracted text is assigned to the variable info.

weather = soup.select('#wob_tm')[0].getText().strip(): This line extracts the temperature information from the weather page using the element with the ID wob_tm. The extracted text is assigned to the variable weather.

print(location), print(time), print(info), print(weather+"Â°C"): These lines print the extracted weather information to the console. It displays the location, time, weather condition, and temperature in Celsius.

weather_info("Copenhagen Weather"): This line calls the weather_info function with the argument "Copenhagen Weather", initiating the retrieval and printing of weather information for the specified city.

Overall, this code retrieves weather information from Google's search results page for a given city using web scraping techniques and displays the extracted information.
